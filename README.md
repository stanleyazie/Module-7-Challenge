# Module-7-Challenge

### Part 1
Yes I was able to isolate tranaction of each cardholder.
The data right now is not sufficient to determine if a credit card is hacked. The reason being that there aren't any easily seen irregularities.

### Part 2

The only anomalies noticed are in march with such a large amount of money spent at bars.
